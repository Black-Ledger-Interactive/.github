# Black Ledger Interactive

**Hard sci-fi games built on real systems.**

Black Ledger Interactive, LLC is an independent game studio focused on simulation-first space strategy games. We care about coherent rules, explainable outcomes, and player stories that emerge from interacting systems. Not from scripted spectacle.

This GitHub organization is where our public-facing technical work lives.


## What We Build

We focus on large-scale, hard sci-fi strategy games with:

- Fleet-level tactics and long-term strategic consequences
- Persistent worlds where actions matter beyond a single session
- High-fidelity simulation: sensors, signatures, logistics, damage, power, heat
- Multiplayer-ready, server-authoritative architecture
- Systems designed to be *understandable*, not opaque

If something happens in our games, the player should be able to learn **why**.


## Design Philosophy

Our work is guided by a few core principles:

- **Simulation first**  
  Systems exist to create tension, planning, and surprise—not realism for its own sake.

- **Legible mechanics**  
  Information may be incomplete, but outcomes should never feel arbitrary.

- **Meaningful constraints**  
  Mass, time, heat, supply, distance, and maintenance are design tools. No busywork here.

- **Player agency over grind**  
  Mastery comes from understanding systems. We avoid repetitive chores.

- **Respect for scale**  
  Big machines, big decisions, big consequences.


## Engineering Approach

From a technical perspective, we emphasize:

- Server-authoritative simulation
- Deterministic thinking where possible
- Clear separation between simulation, protocol, and presentation
- Data-driven design (schemas, definitions, and explicit rules)
- Long-term maintainability over short-term hacks

We design systems that we expect to live for years.


## What Lives in This GitHub Org

You’ll find a mix of:

- Game code (simulation, protocol, tooling)
- World-building and design artifacts (schemas, documentation)
- Infrastructure and build experimentation
- Public technical notes related to our projects

Not everything is open, and not everything here is production-ready. But everything here reflects how we think.


## Current Status

We are actively building toward a playable vertical slice that demonstrates:

- Fleet combat
- Detection and sensor mechanics
- Persistent state and consequences
- Core simulation loops

Development is iterative and methodical. We value getting systems *right* over getting them *fast*.
